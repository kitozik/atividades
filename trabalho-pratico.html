        <h1>History:</h1>
        <em>Freddie Mercury</em> (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 ~ 24 November 1991) was a British singer and songwriter who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist and pianist of the rock band <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen">Queen</a></em>. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen">Queen</a></em>. <br>

Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended English boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed <em>Queen</em> in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury wrote numerous hits for<em>Queen</em>, including <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZBtPf7FOoM">"Killer<em>Queen</em>"</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ">"Bohemian Rhapsody"</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kijpcUv-b8M">"Somebody to Love"</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY">"We Are the Champions"</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM">"Don't Stop Me Now"</em></a> and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO6D_BAuYCI">"Crazy Little Thing Called Love"</em></a>. His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.<br>

Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with <em>Queen</em>, and posthumously featured on their final album, Made in Heaven (1995). In 1991, the day after announcing his diagnosis, he died from complications of the disease at the age of 45. In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. His career with <em>Queen</em> was dramatised in the 2018 biopic <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody_(film)">Bohemian Rhapsody</a></em>.
